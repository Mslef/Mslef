🦊 Tracking & Conservation | Data Science & Wildlife Ecology

I'm passionate about wildlife tracking and conservation, and I use my skills in R, Python, and JavaScript to support research in ecological science.

I work on projects involving:
- frequentist and Bayesian data analysis
- ecological simulations (occupancy models, detection, movement)
- automated detection of animal signs and species (e.g., image, audio, AI-based)

My goal is to build tools and analyses that inform better decision-making in wildlife conservation.

🌲🐾 Always open to collaborations in ecology, citizen science, or spatial analysis.
